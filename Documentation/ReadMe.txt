There is my SwordAndShields.jar. This contains all my tests, my .java files if you wish to look at the source etc.
To run the file, the file PieceData.txt needs to be in the same folder as the SwordAndShields.jar.
CD to file directory and type java -jar SwordsAndShield.jar

This should run without any issues (Hopefully)
